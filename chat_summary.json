They consistently requested the addition of a \"shoryuken\" button to the project, accompanied by questions from the AI regarding its preferred position and triggered actions. The user was presented with multiple placement options for this button, such as the main trading interface, user profile section, or main navigation bar, and possible actions it could execute, including initiating a new trade or opening a modal with detailed information. Acknowledging each request, the AI confirmed it would add the button as specified.\n\nIn addition, the user was offered a variety of supplementary features they might consider implementing, which included a \"Hadoken\" button, live chat support, email response systems, and user customization options. The user repeatedly requested the Hadoken button, leading to similar inquiries about its placement and functionality within the app. The AI acknowledged these requests as well, declaring intentions to add the Hadoken button and other suggested features.\n\nToward the end, the user proposed adding an email form to contact Santa. Following similar patterns, the AI asked for preferences regarding the form's positioning and layout, promising to integrate the user's suggestions accordingly. Throughout the conversation, the AI maintained a responsive and accommodating demeanor, consistently updating the project based on the user\u2019s requests.",
