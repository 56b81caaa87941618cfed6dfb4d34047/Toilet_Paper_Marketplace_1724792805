The AI confirmed each request, stating it would implement the features. Initially, the user was asked about the positioning of the 'Contact Santa' form, with options presented for it to be on the main navigation menu or as a pop-up from every page. The user also needed to specify the information required from users, where options included just name, email, and message or additionally a wish list upload. \n\nFollowing that, the conversation shifted towards adding the 'Hadoken' button. The user was again prompted for its desired placement, either in the main navigation bar or the user profile section, and for functionality, whether it should trigger a unique animation or open a special offers page. The AI noted it would add the Hadoken button along with associated features like animations and sound effects. Throughout this back-and-forth, the user continuously reiterated the request for the 'Hadoken' button.\n\nThe conversation also covered further inquiries about the 'Shoryuken' button, where the same kind of questioning occurred regarding placement and functionality. With each feature request, the AI provided a list of additional features like live chat support and email forms that the user could consider. The user showed interest in implementing an email form to contact Santa, and again options were provided regarding its simplicity or detail. The AI consistently acknowledged the user's requests and confirmed its actions towards implementing each feature. Each interaction focused heavily on confirming the user's preferences for the various functionalities within the project.",
